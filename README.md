_Athaya Zahrani Irmansyah as a Purwadhika JCDS-0408 Student On Site Bandung 2024 / 
Capstone Project Module 1 Python Programming Fundamental with Case Study Student Data Usage (Data Nilai Mahasiswa)_

- Context
  - This project is an implementation of the discussion on Python Programming Fundamentals in Module 1 of JCDS-0408 Purwadhika On Site Bandung 2024. The project creates an application named "Student Grades Data Portal for Calculus Course (Odd Semester) at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Planning in 2024". With the help of CRUD features (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), this program can assist stakeholders in recording student data with several input categories, as well as help calculate the average and determine the final student grade quickly and accurately.
- Main Features. This program contains 6 main menus:
  - Menu 1: Display All Student Data (Read Data)
  - Menu 2: Add Student Data (Create Data)
  - Menu 3: Modify Student Data (Update Data)
  - Menu 4: Delete Student Data (Delete Data)
  - Menu 5: Student Final Grade Information
  - Menu 6: Exit the Program
- Objective
  - Provide an effective solution for stakeholders to store, access, update, and delete data.
  - Assist stakeholders in speeding up the process of calculating student grades and final indexes.
  - Can be used by various types of stakeholders in the academic field.
- Stakeholders
  - Teachers
  - Lecturers
  - Tutors/facilitators
  - Other types of educators
- Limitations
  - Limited input categories (fields/columns/keys) and main menus/features. Input categories and main menus/features may be added or reduced according to stakeholders' needs.
  - Limited data validation required, as data validation is not always the same for each stakeholder.
  - No automatic updates. Data updates need to be done manually. The use of larger and more varied data requires further data conversion techniques.
- User Instructions
  - The data needed in this program includes the Student Identification Number (NIM) as a unique data point, name, major, semester, year, quiz scores, midterm (UTS) scores, and final exam (UAS) scores.
  - Ensure the required data is prepared before inputting and running it in the program.
  - Requires the installation of tabulate to support data display in table form.
  - To run the program, use the '.py' file on this page.
  - Your contribution to this project is highly appreciated. Feel free to contact if you need help, have suggestions/feedback, or want to contribute further to this project.
